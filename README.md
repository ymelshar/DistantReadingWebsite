# WEEKLY PROGRESS


# Week 1:

I decided to make a website because I feel like a main thing I've driven this semester and what was especially bolstered in my time for this class was my love for technology. I decided to make a website on distant reading because it was a concept that stuck out to me in class, something I've done but never really knew the name of, and that was very intriguing to me.

# Week 2:

I began making the website using React and JavaScript, deciding what I wanted to do and the information I wanted to implement. I decided to make it a comparison between Distant and Close reading as I think people should learn the difference between the two like I did. I also researched Case Studies during this time.

# Week 3:

I decided to use Google N-Gram as I think this is the most interesting example of Distant Reading. Seeing the comparison between given words and their frequencies for your own eyes, and being able to play around with different ones, was an enjoyable experience for me. At this point I figured out each thing I wanted to do for the website and finished up implementing all the sections.

# Week 4:

Added some finishing touches to the design of the website and wrote my report.
